# This is my first dApp!

My first dApp ever, deployed on Goerli Test Network.
address on [etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x813966b0b9d23bb30a6fb5c8647f79c512a32a64)

Make sure you have some Goerli ETH and the Goerli network
is active on your wallet (see prerequities below)

This project was inspired by LearnWeb3DAO's Freshman track
lesson "Level 7 - Create An Ethereum Dapp with Ethers.js"

Big thanks to LearnWeb3DAO!
